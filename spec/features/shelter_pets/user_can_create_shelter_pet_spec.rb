# As a visitor
# When I visit a Shelter Pets Index page
# Then I see a link to add a new adoptable pet for that shelter "Create Pet"
# When I click the link
# I am taken to '/shelters/:shelter_id/pets/new' where I see a form to add a new adoptable pet
# When I fill in the form with the pet's:
# - image
# - name
# - description
# - approximate age
# - sex ('female' or 'male')
# And I click the button "Create Pet"
# Then a `POST` request is sent to '/shelters/:shelter_id/pets',
# a new pet is created for that shelter,
# that pet has a status of 'adoptable',
# and I am redirected to the Shelter Pets Index page where I can see the new pet listed
